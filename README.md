# APPLICATION-TRACKING-SYSTEM

This project is a robust application tracking tool developed using Angular, aimed at enhancing the management of candidates, jobs, and applications within an organization. 
The application features an intuitive interface where users can seamlessly add new entries, capturing key details such as the candidate's name, email, job title, and status. 
These entries are then dynamically displayed in a table format, ensuring an organized and efficient tracking system. Leveraging Angular's powerful data binding and component-based architecture, 
the tool ensures a smooth and responsive user experience. Additionally, the project incorporates routing for easy navigation between components and a configuration service for 
centralized management of application settings. 

As a fresher, embarking on this project provided a significant learning experience, particularly in understanding Angular's intricacies and best practices. 
One of the primary challenges faced was adapting to Angular's framework as opposed to Java, which I was more familiar with. Angular's component-based architecture 
required a different approach to structuring the application, and understanding concepts such as data binding, dependency injection, and lifecycle hooks presented 
an initial learning curve. Overcoming these challenges involved extensive research, leveraging community resources, and hands-on experimentation, which ultimately 
enriched my comprehension of modern front-end development practices.

This project not only expanded my technical skills but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities, as I had to devise effective solutions to integrate various functionalities seamlessly. 
The process underscored the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of software development.

I also made a ppt for this task in which i explain what i understand from the project and also the knowledge i gain from this task.
I will add that ppt in file section for reference.
